# Robotics_calculations

This project provides a set of functions for performing various robotics calculations, including transformation matrices and inverse transformations.

## Overview

The project is developed in Rust and utilizes the `nalgebra` library for handling matrix calculations.

## Features

- **Create Transformation Matrix:** Allows users to create a transformation matrix using rotation and translation inputs.
- **Inverse Transformation Matrix:** Provides functionality to calculate the inverse of a transformation matrix.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build and run the project using Cargo.

## Usage

- When the program is run, it presents a list of options to choose from.
- Select an option by entering the corresponding number or name.
- For "Create Transformation Matrix" and "Inverse Transformation Matrix," follow the prompts to enter matrix values.
- Enter "Quit" at any time to exit the program or go back to the list of options.

## Dependencies

- Rust programming language
- `nalgebra` crate for matrix operations
- Other standard Rust crates
